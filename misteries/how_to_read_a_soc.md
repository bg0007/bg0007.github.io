#How to read a SOC report?

[Back to main](https://bg0007.github.io/index.html)

###Problem statement
My company/client utilizes outsourced services.
These services could include:
- physical hardware
- physical location for hardware
- virtual hardware
- leased body
These services are key/significant part of SOX relevant/audit scope processes.
I need to make sure, that all risks, associated with this process are all identified, remediated, corrected or mitigated through controls.
I also have to make sure, that the selected vendor/3rd party is stable enough to continue provisioning such services.

###Solution
I need to identify, what aspects of the process is managed my company/client.
Note: the risk (accountability of the third party ***ALWAYS*** recides at my company/client.

Options:
- my company/client utilizes HW provided by the 3rd party (S/Paas)
- my company/client utilizes and manages HW provided by the 3rd party (Iaas)
- my company/client utilizes HW provided by the 3rd party and the HW is managed by the 3rd party (Saas)

By understanding the *options* I am defining responsibility boundaries.
Internal actions will be covered by the evaluation of internal controls (ToD+ToE).

External actions will be covered by two options:
1. right to audit
2. independent assessment of service providers controls (SOC*, ISO*, etc.)

For this example, we continue with SOC.
For fiscal stability, I check SOC 1 report.

For security and compliance aspects, I check SOC 2 Type1 report for controls. I evaluate, if we have a gap between what we expected, and what the provider has audited in the SOC. If there is a gap, I check contractual agreements, if the vendor provides me additional nevidence for the gap. If not, potential finding.

If I can rely on the SOC 2 Type1, I will look into Type2 to test effectiveness.
If I identify any observation, I evaluate if my business has incorporated in their risk assessment and they defined a proper response. If the observation has not been addressed, then I potenitally have found a gap.
